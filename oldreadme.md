     - III7 (#9) in Aaliyah's [Street Thang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uii0nGTVLsI)
     - Quintessential R Kelly jam from his RnB days (after New Jackswing with Public Announcement and before crossover success)
     - Its written in G Major and includes several Churchy chord progressions using all the seven diatonic chords
     - For instance the introduction includes IV7-vii7b5-IIIsus-`III7`-vi7-V-bV7b5 (not diatonic)
     - Worth pointing out that the only dominant chord apparent is III7 (no V7)
     - This implies or hints at an E Major tonal center
       - All choruses end on III7
       - Return to tonal GI7 after this
       - But the chorus leading to the bridge?
       - Here we move from III7 to `C#minor` (i.e., E Major)
       - Only reason for getting into this detail is the syntactic "transformation"
       - `Meastro` Robert Kelly [deletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis_(linguistics)) I of "implied" recentering to E Major after III7
       - Goes straight to IV-III7-vi-v-`I`
       - Notice that the tonic center of `I` doesn't feel like home in this modulation
       - `vi` is home and feels that way (but "home" in RnB is a restless emotion - ***Boy I wanna let you know, my heart...***)
   
   - Meaning
     - `Diabolus musica` of introductory passage:
       - Begins with `IV-vii`
       - Ends with `bV-I`
       - Tritones in both cases
       - Rather curious since its `a street thing`
     - Ambiguity of III7 in the key of G
     - Begs to resolve to E Major or E minor
     - Yet as a secondary dominant it merely returns to G Major
     - I'll restate here that we never at any point hear the V7; so the ambiguity is effective
     - Modulation to the bridge sounds like its to a distant yet aesthetically appropriate key
     - Our meastro has prepared us for this key although he's deleted the tonic center and kept us around the restless `vi`

   - Set (1-5) forms a pentatonic scale, specifically the `C major pentatonic scale`. The second set (7-10, 12) also forms a pentatonic scale, specifically the `F# major pentatonic scale`. Excluding `B` and `F` from the modern day keyboard would leave two distinct pentatonic scales.
     
   -  An interesting historical irony exists in the acceptance and use of certain pitches in Western music. The medieval perception of the tritone, particularly the pitch F# or Gb, as dissonant and even labeled as "diabolus in musica" contrasted with the acceptance of F, which isn't a natural harmonic in the series but was incorporated into musical practice.

   - The cultural and historical reasons behind these attitudes are complex and often rooted in religious and aesthetic considerations. Musical traditions and practices evolve over time, and decisions about which pitches were considered acceptable or unacceptable were influenced by a variety of factors, including religious beliefs, cultural preferences, and evolving musical theories.

   - As time progressed, composers and musicians explored new harmonic possibilities, and attitudes towards dissonance evolved. The acceptance of F# and the tritone, once considered problematic, became integral to Western classical and later musical styles. This highlights the dynamic and changing nature of musical conventions and the sometimes surprising trajectories of acceptance for various musical elements.
