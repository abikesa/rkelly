#### Generalist

#### Clarity
- Melody
   - lyrics, conversational 
- Chords
   - VI-V7-i 
- Rhythm
   - Pulse
   - Quarter note
#### Art
- Setup for:
   - ii-V-i (bridge)
   - i-ii-I (rising)
#### Signature
- V7 with looped chords (i, ii, i, ii, etc. inversons)
- More obvious in "I believe I can fly"

- Aaron as a session musician would enhance R Kelly
- But its in the composition just as between me & Vince
