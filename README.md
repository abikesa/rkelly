     - III7 (#9) in Aaliyah's [Street Thang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uii0nGTVLsI)
     - Quintessential R Kelly jam from his RnB days (after New Jackswing with Public Announcement and before crossover success)
     - Its written in G Major and includes several Churchy chord progressions using all the seven diatonic chords
     - For instance the introduction includes IV7-vii7b5-IIIsus-`III7`-vi7-V-bV7b5 (not diatonic)
     - Worth pointing out that the only dominant chord apparent is III7 (no V7)
     - This implies or hints at an E Major tonal center
       - All choruses end on III7
       - Return to tonal GI7 after this
       - But the chorus leading to the bridge?
       - Here we move from III7 to `C#minor` (i.e., E Major)
       - Only reason for getting into this detail is the syntactic "transformation"
       - `Meastro` Robert Kelly [deletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis_(linguistics)) I of "implied" recentering to E Major after III7
       - Goes straight to IV-III7-vi-v-`I`
       - Notice that the tonic center of `I` doesn't feel like home in this modulation
       - `vi` is home and feels that way (but "home" in RnB is a restless emotion - ***Boy I wanna let you know, my heart...***)
